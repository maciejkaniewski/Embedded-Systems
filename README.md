# Embedded-Systems

Repository Embedded-Systems presents suggested solutions to tasks that had to be completed in the first semester of my Master's studies within the Embedded-Systems course at the Wroclaw University of Technology in the field of Control Engineering and Robotics. The tasks were implemented on the `STM32F407G-DISC1` board equipped with the `STM32F407VG` core. The `Keil µVision 5 IDE` was used to program the board.
